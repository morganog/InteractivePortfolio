# InteractivePortfolio

## How to Use?

This interactive portfolio is very easy to use! Inside the "img" folder contains an image that is a blank Google search with tabs open.

I created an image map for this image, so that when you click on the tabs it will open a new tab which will direct you to that site. 

Inside the main.html file you can change the href to redirect to your actual account. There are documented steps to help you do that!

To change the image simply take a snippet of google with your preferred tabs. You might have to make a new image map which can be easily done by adding on to preexisting code OR by simply changing the coords.
